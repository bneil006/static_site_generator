# Better Personal Python Docs

[Back Home](/)

## I'd like to start creating better docs for myself

During this process of going through boot.dev and following other tutorials online, I've come to learn that I'm really bad about reading technical documentation.
I'd like to take a crack at using this static site generator to hold onto some of the trickier parts of code and areas I struggle with the most and use it to reference
back anytime I need.

`python` is my main language because i'm interested in backend but I feel like i have to learn `javaScript` at some point so that I can get a better understanding of
how the front and back ends work together, the ultimate goal is to mesh the two.

## Placeholder for items and documentation to come

```
def main():
    print("Hello, World!")
```
